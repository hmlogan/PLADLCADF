    "Welcome to the Plastic Additives LCA Data Finder (PLAD LCA DF). This notebook is designed to help you search existing LCA databases to determine which additives have data coverage and are available for inclusion in your LCA. This database links state-of-the-art knowledge from both the Plastchem database (2024) and the UNEP chemicals in plastics database (2023) to additives coverage in the ecoinvent 3.9.1 & 3.10, LCA for Experts 2023, and CarbonMinds 2022 LCA databases following the approach developed in Logan et al. (2024). To read more about this method please refer to Logan et al (2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully execute the notebook, you will need to download the PLAD LCA DF folder from the GitHub repository and extract it in your chosen location. From there the notebook will prompt you to add the correct file path and run a fresh database for you. The LCA database (LCADB) and Additive database (ADDDB) files are updated occasionally so running a fresh database is recommended. If you would like to skip possible updates or correction and directly access the original database, you may open PLAD_LCADF_0524_v0.0.xlsx.\n",
